Calls for federal projects are associated with the New Deal. Abandoning seaside communities never occurred in any significant way. A federal income tax was instituted in 1913 with the passage of the 16th Amendment after protectionist tariffs were reduced. A religious awakening did not occur as a result of the hurricane.\nPrevious       Next",
